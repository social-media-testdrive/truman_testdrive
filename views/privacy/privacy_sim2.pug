    p.greyOut The Service is controlled and operated by the Cornell Social Media Lab in the United States, and your use of the Service is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. We may, in our discretion, decide to limit the Service’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time at our sole discretion.

    
    h2 2. <span class="highlightOnHover">What Information Do We Collect?</span> 
    p#hint1

    p.greyOut <span class="bigTextOnHover">In this Policy, Personal Information means information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual online or offline, such as the individual's name, email address, phone number, or a persistent identifier</span> that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different sites or services. Non-Personal Information is aggregated information,  demographic information and other user information that does not reveal a person's identity.

    h3 Children's Information. 
    p.greyOut <span class="highlightOnHover bigTextOnHover">The Service does not collect Personal Information. The Service is used anonymously.</span> Users can enter any lesson module as a guest, which will automatically create a one-time-use user account. Once the user finishes a module or leaves the Service, the user will be asked whether they are willing to share their clickstream, textual input and the end-of-module knowledge quiz results (activity log data generated as the user went through the module) to help our development team test, research, and  improve the TestDrive platform. <span class="bigTextOnHover">The activity log data are anonymous and do NOT include any personal information that enables us to trace back to any individual user. </span> All personal information (names, addresses, emails, school names etc.), if any, that appeared in users’ textual input will be filtered and deleted before data analysis. If the user consents to share his/her activity log data with us, we will include his/her data in our database for further analysis and research to better understand how users learn on the TestDrive platform in order to develop and improve our services.  If the user declines to share his/her log data, the system will delete all activity logs associated with this guest account. There is no way this guest account can be recovered or reused by users or by the Social Media Lab.
    
    p.greyOut The user activity log data on this site will be used strictly for improving user experience in the future and supporting academic research, and will NOT be disclosed to marketing companies or other third parties who are not directly involved in the provision of this service. All data used for research purposes will be reported in ways that will NOT reveal any user’s identity.  Data will be stored in a safe hard drive of the Social Media Lab and in secure Cornell Box folders and which will be only accessible by the research team of Social Media TestDrive.

You can access Qualtrics’ Privacy Policy at https://www.qualtrics.com/privacy-statement/. This Policy does not address, nor do we accept responsibility for, the manner in which schools or other third parties collect, use, or share information derived from the Service.
