=======================

Social Media TestDrive is an online learning program delivered through a life-like social media simulation that provides youth a safe space to learn and practice digital literacy and citizenship skills. 

The platform simulates realistic digital dilemmas and scenarios that young people may encounter as they enter the social media world. Each module teaches essential digital citizenship concepts, covering topics such as privacy, online identities, cyberbullying, and more.

Social Media TestDrive was created by a multidisciplinary team of researchers, designers, and developers at Cornell's Social Media Lab, and a collaboration with Common Sense Education.

This project and software development was supported by the generosity of Becky and Jim Morgan and National Science Foundation awards #1405634 and #2006588.

Also special thanks to Sahat Yalkabov and his [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) project, which provided the basic organization for this project.
